"Hello world!" said the AI, using smart quotes.
'Single quotes' are also problematic.

• Non-breaking space: [there's one here] between words
• Thin space: [very thin space] barely visible
• Em space: [wide space] much wider

Special punctuation:
• Horizontal ellipsis: … (three dots)
• Various hyphens: ‐ ‑ ‒ ―

Angle quotes:
• French quotes: « guillemets »
• Single angles: ‹ example ›

Low quotes:
• Single low: ‚example
• Double low: „example
